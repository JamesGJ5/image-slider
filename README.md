Object-oriented image slider made with some random, royalty-free images.

src/ is a result of the first time I learned and tried hard to adhere to SLAP (Single Level of Abstraction Principle).

Object-oriented programming was done using JavaScript classes; I know to implement object-oriented programming in the more functional-based style but for this small project the choice between the two was fairly arbitrary.

If you'd like to see the image slider in action, clone the repo locally and open the local path of /dist/index.html in the browser. Otherwise, paste the GitHub URL for /dist/index.html into htmlpreview.github.io/
